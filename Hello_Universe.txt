What an intersting time we are having.
Are we alone in the universe?
Are we alone within ourselves
Sometimes I wonder if everyone is simply dealt a hand and required to play it.
Is this fate?
Is it Destiny?
Can we break out of this assigned loop that we appear stuck in.
Im terrified to leave my comfot zone but im terrified of never amounting to anything
How can i move forward in my life if I dont try new things or take opportunities.
Im sick of being jealous
Im sick of being frustrated
Im sick of always blaming my problems and inconvenieces on other people.
Why cant I just do better, be better, try harder?
It sucks
Its uncomfortable. I want instant gratification. I despise change
Changing, Developing, Growing
is scary...
Im scared to do whats best for myself.
I just want to exist, with no stress, with no worries, helping other people.
Is that so much to ask?
